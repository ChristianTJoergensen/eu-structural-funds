# Cohesion and Structural funds datasets

This is a collecting the datasets for the EU Structural and Cohesion funds from all the different national and regional portals. The goal is to get an overview of all these datasets (not just the portals) in one place, clean the data, and map them in one format ( fdp from os-packager).

We started with a simple google sheet (see the spreadsheet here above). But as our search got more extensive, we have now moved to github. Every country has a file which contains a readme, describing the data, and the data files itself.
